<h3>About Karolina</h3>
<p>Karolina, better known as Karol, has been doing nails for 10 years and after working at a variety of different salons in Massachusetts, decided that the best option would be to open up her own place. With a strong fan base, Karol's clients have followed her everywhere she goes. Currently residing in Revere, Karol's shop is now in-home. New to motherhood and not willing to pause her growing career she felt this was the best way to enjoy both worlds. Having her daughter close by only pushes her harder to be better than she already is.
  <br>
  <br>Her clients will describe her as a great listener, respectful, wise, passionate and very funny. For Karol, it's about not just having beautiful nails, but healthy ones. Karol limits no expense when comes to having healthy nails and making sure they're being taken care of safely. With so many salons cutting corners or not following state protocol Karol knows how difficult it is to find a salon you can trust. With Karol you can rest assured you're in safe hands.</p>
